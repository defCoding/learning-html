# Learning HTML

This repo simply contains the HTML/CSS files from the notes I am taking from the book HTML&CSS Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett. I'm using this as a way to document my learning, and also to maintain a reference sheet for if I ever need to review my notes after forgetting a concept or feature.
